# what is a super neet?

![super neet post](/assets/super_neet_post.png)

It's not just that super neets want to have fun - their identity, tastes, and
abilities have been refined beyond anything you typically see in distribution.

Looking into their past life, you might notice a pattern of anime pfps, autism,
nootropics, and other obscure traits and behaviors...

You might also find it difficult to relate to them...

> - \> some freak life trajectory from an early age
> - \> lived through a unique time in history
> - \> wealthy/intelligent family
> - \> seemingly irredeemable character trait

Look past the fun and eccentric personas and you'll find honest people who
still had to figure out the path to becoming extremely well-rounded:

1. strong executive function
2. deep in a skill tree + well-versed across domains
3. highly charismatic

These people just tend to work hard + read a lot (internet, blogs, books, etc.)

# hypothesis

> "neet" is end game.

"**super neet**" - virtually infinite resources, traversing every branch of the
tech tree, roaming around handing out side quests to other players

No one reaches this point by trying to be particularly "weird". You're
observing people who are just trying to fully express their agency.

Any good MMO, leaves room for players to find their own ways to have fun.

> \> no chat/voice?

wave your mouse around, spam crouch, or jump up and down

> \> no cute anime backgrounds?

You know what it feels like when you're able to do things you actually _want_
to do, but it's easy to lose sight of it as you let the years go by...

# the super neet filter

The world we created is hostile towards ordinary neets.

Born to neet, forced to fit the norm.

> \> go to school -> get a job -> buy a house -> ...

This is good, actually. 

> - \> learning things 
> - \> being employed in a salaried job
> - \> working well with your peers

"Doing things that normal people do" keeps you grounded in reality and you'll
be rewarded quite well for being a good participant in this system.

Deep down you know it could be so much better, but you might be too far gone...
you already sold out.

The thing about pursuing neet life *later* on is that the path is not obvious
and things will get much worse before it can ever get better.

This is the super neet filter.

# worth an attempt

Many overstate the difficulty and underestimate the time it takes to get
there.

We can still win the war on neets, there's a way out.

Become the neet in the shadows. Become the **employed neet**.
